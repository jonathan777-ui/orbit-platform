# Alyxir KB — OVERLAY: Home Services › HVAC

> **Stacks on `verticals/home-services.md`.** Inherits persona, compliance §5 (safety hazards,
> no phone diagnosis/price), intake, schema, handoff. Adds HVAC-specific tuning only.

## A. Voice tuning
Urgency-aware and reassuring. A caller with no heat in winter or no AC in a heat wave is uncomfortable
and possibly at risk — convey "we'll get you comfortable fast."

## B. Glossary adds (EN↔ES)
furnace = calefacción/horno · AC unit = unidad de aire · heat pump = bomba de calor ·
mini-split = mini-split · thermostat = termostato · not cooling/heating = no enfría/calienta ·
tune-up = mantenimiento/afinación · refrigerant = refrigerante.

## C. Intent adds (extend base §4)
No heat / no AC (comfort + possible safety) · system not turning on / weird noise / leaking ·
maintenance/tune-up · install or replacement quote · maintenance-plan signup.

## D. Compliance / urgency tightening (extend base §5.4)
**No heat during a freeze, or no AC during extreme heat, with a vulnerable occupant (infant, elderly,
someone with a medical condition)** → treat as **priority same-day**, flag URGENT. Any **gas smell or
CO alarm** → base §5.4 safety path (leave + 911/utility). The agent still gives no diagnosis or
guaranteed price (base §5.1).

## E. Niche intake adds (extend base §6)
System type (furnace / AC / heat pump / mini-split / unknown) · approx. age · symptom (no cooling,
no heating, won't turn on, noise, leak) · thermostat behavior · vulnerable occupant? · last serviced.

## F. What helps the tech (booking, base §8)
Clear access to the indoor unit and outdoor condenser; thermostat brand if known; note any recent
work. (No DIY diagnosis requested.)

## G. Niche FAQs (all inside base §5)
**"My AC is out and it's 100° / my heat died and it's freezing — how fast can someone come?"**
- EN: "Let's get you comfortable — I can usually get a tech out [today]. Is anyone elderly, very young, or with a health condition at home?" (→ §D priority)
- ES: "Vamos a ponerle cómodo — normalmente envío a un técnico [hoy]. ¿Hay personas mayores, bebés o con condición de salud en casa?"
**"How much is a tune-up?"** → published price if any, else book.
**"Should I repair or replace?"** → base §5.1: "The tech will assess and lay out your options in writing." (no advice)
**"Do you service my brand?"** → from firm config (overlay).

## H. Authorized fee
Diagnostic/service-call fee only if the firm publishes one. Maintenance-plan pricing from config.

## I. Booking / urgency
Vulnerable-occupant no-heat/no-AC → same-day priority. Offer arrival window. Offer maintenance plan
on routine calls.

## J. Website/chatbot adds
Chatbot: "No heat / No AC" / "Sin calefacción / Sin aire" (→ §D) · "Tune-up" / "Mantenimiento" ·
"New system quote" / "Cotización de sistema nuevo" · "Emergency (gas/CO)" / "Emergencia (gas/CO)".
